    <blockquote>
      <p>AblePay Health, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&ldquo;AblePay&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;,
        or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) provides this error-resolution notice in compliance with the Federal Reserveâ€™s Regulation E,
        which governs electronic fund transfers (referred to hereinafter as &ldquo;EFT&rdquo; or &ldquo;EFTs&rdquo;).</p>
      <p class="italic">Consumer Liability (&sect;205.7(b)(1)).</p>
      <p>Tell us AT ONCE if you believe that an electronic fund transfer (EFT) has been made without your permission using information
        from your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible losses down. If you tell us within 2 business
        days after you learn of the unauthorized EFT, you can lose no more than $50 if someone made the EFT without your
        permission.</p>
      <p>If you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the unauthorized EFT, and we can prove we could have
        stopped someone from using your Account (as defined in Regulation E) without your permission if you had told us,
        you could lose as much as $500.</p>
      <p>Also, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, code or other means, tell
        us at once. If you do not tell us within 60 days after the statement was emailed to you, you may not get back any
        money you lost after the 60 days if we can prove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you
        had told us in time. If a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will
        extend the time periods.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Contact in event of unauthorized transfer (&sect;205.7(b)(2)).</span> If you believe your Account
        has been accessed by someone who is unauthorized, call: 484-292-4000 or email
        <a href="mailto:support@ablepayhealth.com">support@ablepayhealth.com</a> You should also call the number or send
        an email to the address listed above if you believe a transfer has been made using the information from your check
        without your permission.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Business days (&sect;205.7(b)(3)).</span> For purposes of these disclosures, our business days
        are Monday through Friday. Holidays are (not) included.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Transfer types and limitations (&sect;205.7(b)(4))</span></p>
      <ol>
        <li> Account access. You may use your AblePay account to pay for your approved out-of-pocket medical expenses owed to
          third party healthcare providers (&ldquo;Medical Expenses&rdquo;) only as described
        </li>
        <br>
        <ol class="list-2">
          <li>Limitations on frequency of transfers. You may authorize AblePay to make a one-time or recurring electronic payment
            from your checking, savings, or card account using information from your check to pay for Medical Expenses through
            AblePay Health for each bill for such Medical Expenses provided to and accepted by AblePay.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>Limitations on dollar amounts of transfers. You may authorize AblePay to make a single payment up to $5,000 to
            pay for Medical Expenses through AblePay or you may authorize AblePay to make multiple payments up to $5,000
            per month to pay for Medical Expenses through AblePay only as described in these Terms.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="italic">Fees (&sect;205.7(b)(5)</span> AblePay will not charge you a fee for transfers you make to pay
        for Medical Expenses through AblePay.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Confidentiality (&sect;205.7(b)(9)).</span> We will disclose information to third parties about
        your account or the transfers you make: (i) Where it is necessary for completing transfers; (ii) In order to verify
        the existence and condition of your account for a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant; (iii) In order
        to comply with government agency or court orders; or (iv) If you give us your written permission.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Documentation (&sect;205.7(b)(6).</span> You can print a confirmation receipt at the time you
        make any transfer to pay for Medical Expenses through AblePay.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Periodic statements.</span> All of your transaction will be available to you online.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Preauthorized payments (&sect;205.7(b) (6), (7) and (8); &sect;205.10(d))</span></p>
      <p><span class="italic">Right to stop payment and procedure for doing so.</span> If you have told us in advance to make
        regular payments out of your Account, you can stop any of these payments. Here's how:</p>
      <p>Call us at 484-292-4000 or email us at <a href="mailto:support@ablepayhealth.com">support@ablepayhealth.com </a>, or
        write us at AblePay Health, P.O. Box 1278, Bethlehem, PA 18016-1278 in time for us to receive your request 3 business
        days or more before the payment is scheduled to be made. If you call, we may also require you to put your request
        in writing and get it to us within 14 days after you call. (We will charge you [insert amount] for each stop-payment
        order you give.)</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Notice of varying amounts.</span> If these regular payments may vary in amount, we will email
        you, 10 days before each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be. (You may choose instead to get this
        notice only when the payment would differ by more than a certain amount from the previous payment, or when the amount
        would fall outside certain limits that you set.)</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Liability for failure to stop payment of preauthorized transfer.</span> If you order us to stop
        one of these payments 3 business days or more before the transfer is scheduled, and we do not do so, we will be liable
        for your losses or damages.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Financial institution's liability (&sect;205.7(b)(8)).</span> If we do not complete a transfer
        to or from your Account on time or in the correct amount according to our agreement with you, we will be liable for
        your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance: (i) If, through
        no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your Account to make the transfer; (ii) If the transfer would go
        over the credit limit on your overdraft line; (iii) If our website was not working properly and you knew about the
        breakdown when you started the transfer; (iv) If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire or flood) prevent
        the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken.</p>
      <p>In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers Telephone us at 484-292-4000. Write us at AblePay Health,
        P.O. Box 1278, Bethlehem, PA 18016-1278 or email us at <a href="mailto:support@ablepayhealth.com">support@ablepayhealth.com</a>        as soon as you can, if you think your statement or confirmation receipt is wrong or if you need more information
        about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we made available
        to you via email, the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Tell us your name and AblePay account number (if any).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is
          an error or why you need more information.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="nostyle">If you tell us orally, we require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="nostyle">We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error
          promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days to investigate your complaint or question. If
          we decide to do this, we will credit your Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error,
          so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. We require
          you to put your complaint or question in writing and if we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not
          credit your Account.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="nostyle">For errors involving new Accounts, point-of-sale, or foreign-initiated transactions, we may take up to 90 days to
          investigate your complaint or question. For new Accounts, we may take up to 20 business days to credit your Account
          for the amount you think is in error.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li class="nostyle">We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there
          was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our
          investigation.
        </li>
