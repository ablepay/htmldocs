      <h4>PAYMENT METHOD</h4>
      <p>
        I acknowledge I am setting up a payment method that authorizes AblePay
        to charge any AblePay Service Partner Health Related
        Payments (“Payments”) to my debit / credit card(s), or I authorize my
        bank to deduct Payment(s) from my checking
        / savings account, according to the schedule preference I have selected
        to pay for a health-related expense incurred
        by the presentation of my AblePay membership card to an authorized
        serviced provider. If AblePay is unable to secure
        funds from my debit / credit card(s) or my bank for any reason,
        including, but not limited to, insufficient funds
        in my debit / credit card or bank account or insufficient or inaccurate
        information provided by me when submitting
        my electronic payment, AblePay may undertake further collection action,
        including application of fees to the extent
        permitted by law. You may change your default payment method and term
        for each claim up to five days after receiving
        notification that your initial payment is due. You can make that change
        by logging into your AblePay member portal.
      </p>
      <h4>FAILED TRANSACTION FEE</h4>
      <p>
        If AblePay Heath, LLC (“AblePay” or “We”) attempts to collect a payment
        that you have authorized (whether as a single payment,
        reoccurring payment or otherwise) and AblePay is unable to collect that
        payment for any reason, including, without
        limitation, insufficient funds, you will be charged according to the
        following fee schedule: $35 for each item (maximum
        1 Failed Transaction Fee per day; 3 per 30-day period). We will contact
        you in the event We are unable to collect
        a payment. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that all payment
        information is correct and there are sufficient
        funds when the next attempt to collect payment is made. Our next
        attempt to collect payment will be the next business
        day following the failed attempt. If you have any questions, or require
        assistance please contact AblePay at 484-292-4000
        between the hours of 9:00 am EDT and 5:00 pm EDT or
        support@ablepayhealth.com. If we are unable to collect the payment
        on the same item multiple times, you may be charged up to 3 times for
        that item within a 30-day period.
