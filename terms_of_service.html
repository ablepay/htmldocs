          healthcare
          providers that accept payments from AblePay (&ldquo;Providers&rdquo;)
          through
          the Service using your selected payment option(s). You understand,

          and agree that: (i) any Billed Amount submitted on or to AblePay may

          Service,

          an
          Account for the Service, you must provide AblePay with an electronic
          mail
          address and other information (&ldquo;Registration Data&rdquo;). You
          are

          or
          incomplete, AblePay has the right to suspend or terminate your
          Account
          and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any

          third
          parties, to make any inquiries AblePay considers necessary to
          validate
          your Account Registration Data. By using the Service (and registering
          an
          Account on the Service), you represent and warrant that are at least
          18
          years of age. No one under the age of 18 may use the Service;

          parent
          or legal guardian of such minor(s) if such minor(s) are added to such
          parent
          or legal guardian&#8217;s Account. AblePay may, in its sole
          discretion,
          refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity and change its
          eligibility
          criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that
          these
          Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and
          regulations
          applicable to you and the right to access the Service is revoked
          where
          these Terms of Service or use of the Service is prohibited or to the
          extent
          offering, sale or provision of the Service conflicts with any
          applicable
          law, rule or regulation. AblePay has no liability to you or any
          third-party
          for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with your
          obligations
          specified herein. You agree that AblePay may store and use the
          registration
          information you provide to maintain and bill applicable fees to your

          will
          be directed, and you will be responsible to respond to such
          communications.
          If you think there is problem or error related to any of the Service
          or
          with your Account, you should IMMEDIATELY contact AblePay at
          <a href="http://www.ablepayhealth.com"
             target="_blank">www.ablepayhealth.com</a>. AblePay must hear
          from you within sixty (60) days following the FIRST notification in
          which
          the potential problem or error appeared. AblePay will investigate any
          error
          within forty-five (45) days and tell you the results within three (3)
          days
          after completing AblePay&#8217;s investigation.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="underline">ACH/EFT.</span> AblePay allows you to use
          electronic
          funds transfers (&ldquo;EFT&rdquo;) such as using your bank account
          for
          electronic check (eCheck) payments. This payment method is also
          called
          ACH debit, as it uses the Automated Clearing-House network. All EFT
          and
          ACH transactions are subject to AblePay&#8217;s error resolution
          notices,
          which can be linked to directly from AblePay&#8217;s homepage. Your
          completion
          of an eCheck payment constitutes your authorization to transfer the
          sum
          specified by you from your bank account to AblePay. After authorizing
          an
          ACH debit or AutoPay, you will not be able to cancel the electronic
          transfer.
          Completion of any payment via the Service is contingent on both
          authorization
          by the card company or the paying bank and acceptance by AblePay. If
          a
          payment is rejected or declined, you may be subject to penalties,
          late
          fees, insufficient funds (&ldquo;NSF&rdquo;) fees, and/or interest
          charges
          as assessed by us (see Failed Transaction Fee above) or as assessed
          by
          your banking or card institution. All payments made through the
          Service
          are final (unless rejected by the Providers), and you may not request
          or
          eek any refund or chargeback or otherwise cancel or reverse such a
          payment
          once authorized. You and not AblePay are responsible for ensuring
          that
          timely payments of all amounts are made. further, you and not AblePay
          are
          responsible to ensure that the amount of any payment you make using
          the
          Service is correct.

          AblePay&#8217;s
          advertising or any related purchase, if any, SHALL BE RESOLVED
          EXCLUSIVELY
          AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION. The arbitrator shall have
          exclusive
          authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or
          enforceability
          of this arbitration provision including any unconscionability
          challenge
          or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or these Terms
          of
          Service is void, voidable or otherwise invalid. The arbitration shall
          be
          administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS
          (or
          a substitute forum if both are unavailable). Arbitration proceedings
          shall
          be governed by this provision and the applicable procedures of the
          selected
          arbitration administrator, including any applicable procedures for
          consumer-related
          disputes, in effect at the time the claim is filed. The arbitration
          will
          be limited solely to your individual dispute or controversy. You
          agree
          to arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU
          NOR
          AblePay SHALL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST
          OTHER
          USERS OF THE SERVICE, OR ARBITRATE OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY
          CLAIM
          AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
          GENERAL
          CAPACITY. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found
          unenforceable,
          the unenforceable provision shall be severed and the remaining
          arbitration
          terms shall be enforced (but in no case shall there be class
          arbitration).
          The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be
          available
          in court under law or in equity. The arbitration shall be governed by
          the
          Federal Arbitration Act 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA). Any award of the
          arbitrator(s)
          shall be final and binding on each of the parties, and may be entered
          as
          a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Payment for all
          filing,
          administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the rules of
          the
          applicable arbitration administrator, provided, that AblePay will
          reimburse
          those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the
          arbitrator
          determines the claims are frivolous. If you prevail on any claim that
          affords
          the prevailing party statutory attorneys&#8217; fees, the arbitrator
          may
          award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting
          provided
          by law. Information on AAA or JAMS and their applicable rules are
          available

          proceeds in court rather than in arbitration each of you and AblePay
          waive
          any right to a jury trial. Moreover, each of you and AblePay both
          agree
          that either party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or

          To opt out, you must notify AblePay in writing no later than 30 days
          after
          first becoming subject to this arbitration agreement. Your notice

          address you used to set up your AblePay account (if you have one),
          and
          an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration
          agreement.
          You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: AblePay,

          Notwithstanding
          the foregoing, you agree and acknowledge that AblePay may bring a
          proceeding
          against you in small claims court for any claim that may be properly
          brought
          therein.
