    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This E-Sign Disclosure and Consent Notice (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) applies to all Communications (as defined below) provided
        by AblePay Health, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our affiliates (&ldquo;AblePay&rdquo; or &ldquo;We&rdquo;).
        Under this Notice, you are explicitly agreeing that Communications you receive in electronic form from us will be
        considered &ldquo;in writing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        By using AblePay electronic and online services (&ldquo;Electronic Services&rdquo;) you hereby consent to this Notice and
        affirm that you have access to the hardware and software requirements identified below. In addition, you must review
        and accept the terms of these services. If you choose not to consent to this Notice or you withdraw your consent,
        you will be restricted from using Electronic Services.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">COVERED COMMUNICATIONS</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Communications&rdquo; means any and all disclosures and communications we provide to you regarding our services,
        including, without limitation: (i) terms and conditions, privacy statement or notices and any changes thereto; (ii)
        pre-payment disclosures, transaction receipts and confirmations; and (iii) customer service communications (such
        as claims of error communications).
      </p>
      <p class="bold">METHODS OF PROVIDING COMMUNICATIONS</p>
      <p>We may provide Communications to you by email or by making them accessible on the AblePay websites, mobile pplications,
        or mobile websites (including via &ldquo;hyperlinks&rdquo; provided online and in e-mails). Communications will be
        provided online and viewable using browser software or PDF files.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS</p>
      <p>To access and retain electronic Communications, you must have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A valid email address;
        </li>
        <li>A computer, mobile device, tablet or similar device with internet access and current browser software and computer
          software that is capable of receiving, accessing, displaying, and either printing or storing Communications received
          from us in electronic form; and
        </li>
        <li>Sufficient storage space to save Communications (whether presented online, in e-mails or PDF) or the ability to print
          Communications.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may request that you respond to an email to demonstrate you are able to receive these Communications.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">HOW TO WITHDRAW YOUR CONSENT</p>
      <p>You may withdraw your consent to receive Communications under this Notice by writing to us at &ldquo;Attn: E-Sign Disclosure
        and Consent Notice, AblePay Health, P.O. Box 1278 Bethlehem, PA 18016-1278&rdquo; or by contacting us via the &ldquo;Contact
        Us&rdquo; link at <a href="https://ablepayhealth.com/contact" target="_blank">https://ablepayhealth.com/contact</a>.
        Your withdrawal of consent will cancel your agreement to receive electronic Communications, and therefore, your ability
        to use our Electronic Services.
      </p>
      <p class="bold">REQUESTING PAPER COPIES OF ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS</p>
      <p>You may request a paper copy of any Communications; we will mail you a copy via U.S. Mail. To request a paper copy,
        contact us by writing to &ldquo;Attn: E-Sign Disclosure and Consent Notice, AblePay Health, P.O. Box 1278 Bethlehem,
        PA 18016-1278&rdquo; or by contacting us via the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; link atÂ <a href="https://ablepayhealth.com/contact">https://ablepayhealth.com/contact</a>.
        Please provide your current mailing address so we can process this request. AblePay may charge you a reasonable fee
        for this service.

        <p class="bold">UPDATING YOUR CONTACT INFORMATION</p>
        <p><span class="bold">It is your responsibility to keep your primary email address current so that AblePay can communicate
    with you electronically. </span> You understand and agree that if AblePay sends you a Communication but you do not receive
          it because your primary email address on file is incorrect, out of date, blocked by your service provider, or you
          are otherwise unable to receive electronic Communications, AblePay will be deemed to have provided the Communication
          to you; provided, however, we may deem your account inactive. You may not be able to transact using our Online
          Services until we receive a valid, working primary email address from you.
        </p>
        <p>If you use a spam filter or similar software that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email
          address book, we recommend that you add AblePay to your email address book so that you can receive Communications
          by e-mail.
        </p>
        <p>You can update your primary email address or other information by writing to us at &ldquo;Attn: E-Sign Disclosure
          and Consent Notice, AblePay Health, P.O. Box 1278 Bethlehem, PA 18016-1278&rdquo; or by contacting us via the &ldquo;Contact
          Us&rdquo; link at
          <a href="https://ablepayhealth.com/contact" target="_blank">https://ablepayhealth.com/contact</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">FEDERAL LAW</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that your consent to electronic Communications is being provided in connection with a transaction
          affecting interstate commerce that is subject to the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
          Act (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), and that you and we both intend that the Act apply to the fullest extent possible
          to validate our ability to conduct business with you by electronic means.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">TERMINATION/CHANGES</p>
        <p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to discontinue the provision of your Communications, or to terminate
          or change the terms and conditions on which we provide Communications. We will provide you with notice of any such
          termination or change as required by law.
        </p>
