      <p class="content">
        By using the Services, you signify your acceptance of this policy and
        any changes to this policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please
        do not use the Services. If you are outside of the United States, do not

      <div class="title">Collection of Information</div>
      <p class="content">
        <i>Information You Provide to Us.</i> We collect information you provide
        directly to us when you do things such as call us on the phone, enroll
        for the Services, sign up to receive our emails, or otherwise
        communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include:
        (1) your name, date of birth, email address, physical address, gender,
        social security number, marital status, employment, income, and desired
        payment term; (2) if you choose to enroll additional members in the
        Services, then the names, dates of birth and gender of such individuals;
        and (3) any other information you choose to provide (collectively,
        &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;). We also collect your payment
        information and certain health information in order to provide the
        Services, (&ldquo;Sensitive Information&rdquo;).
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        <i>Payment Information.</i>
        We use secure, third-party payment processors, to process your payment
        information. When adding a payment method, either Bank or Card, your
        information is sent directly from your device to a third-party payment
        processor (please see
        <a href="./terms_of_service.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>).
        The third-party payment processors associate the payment method with
        your AblePay account, allowing us to complete charges or refunds,
        without AblePay ever viewing your Sensitive Information.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        <i>Health Information.</i>
        We receive medical bills from you, your health provider, and third-party
        processors. Any and all health information that is provided to us and/or
        shared directly from members is protected and covered under the Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The sharing of
        your Sensitive Information is only done with entities that are
        required to complete authorized transactions on behalf of our members. 
        We share only the minimum information that is necessary in order to
        fulfill our duties on your behalf.

      <p class="content">
        <i>Cookies.</i> Our website only requires first-party cookies to be

        to you. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this
        could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.
