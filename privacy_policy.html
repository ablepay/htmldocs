        and subsidiaries (&ldquo;AblePay&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we&rdquo;) collect, use and
        share information about you. This policy applies to information we collect when you access our websites, applications,
        interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, content downloads and/or other services (collectively, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;),
        or otherwise interact with us as described below. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make
        changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this policy, and in some cases, we may provide you
        with additional notice (such as adding a statement to the homepages of our websites or sending you an email notification).
        We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with us to stay informed about our information
        practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings
        ascribed thereto in our <a href="/html/terms_of_service.html" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

            <li><span class="underline">In General.</span> We may collect Personal Information and other information. &ldquo;Personal
              Information&rdquo; means individually identifiable information that would allow us to determine the actual
              identity of, and contact, a specific living person. We may collect this information through a website, mobile
              application, or other online services. By using our Service, you are authorizing us to gather, parse and retain
              data related to the provision of the Service.

              about you when you interact with our Service, websites or emails, including information about your browsing
              and purchasing behavior. We may combine this information with other information we collect about you and use
              it for various purposes, such as improving our Service and your online experience, understanding which areas
              and features of our sites are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our
              communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been
              clicked and for other internal business purposes.

          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Information We Collect From Our Partners.</span> We may also obtain both personal and non-personal
          information about you from other AblePay businesses, business partners, and other sources and combine that with

          or using our websites or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing and transfer of information
          in and to the U.S. and other countries.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Sharing of Information.</span> We may share information about you as follows: (i) with vendors,
          consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf; (ii)
          with our business partners and other third parties for purposes of sending their own direct mail; (iii) in response

          third-parties related thereto, including, financial networks, bank, and our other partners (and our and their respective
          affiliates, agents, subcontractors, and employees).  Anyone that we share information with may use the information
          to perform their obligations under their agreements with us, to operate and promote their respective networks,
          to perform analytics and create reports, to prevent fraud, and for any other lawful purpose. Any of our partners
          may also make eligibility determinations and inform us that you are not permitted to use the Service. We may also
          share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Advertising and Analytics.</span> We engage third parties to serve advertisements on our
          behalf across the Internet and to provide analytics services. These entities may use cookies, web beacons and other
          technologies to collect information about your use of our websites, such as your IP address, web browser, pages
          viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others
          to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising
          and content targeted to your interests through ur Service and other websites and better understand your online
          or offline activity. We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on
          other websites or platforms.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Links to Other Sites.</span> Our Service may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible
          for the privacy practices or policies of those sites. Any use of Personal Information provided to third parties
          will be governed by their privacy statements and policies.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Security.</span> We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss,
          theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Despite these measures, however,
          no security measures are completely impenetrable.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Account Information.</span> You may update, correct or delete your online account information
          at any time by logging into your account and navigating to the &ldquo;My Account&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Profile&rdquo;
          page. We may retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Cookies.</span> Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you
          can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies, but note that doing so does not necessarily affect third
          party flash cookies used in connection with our websites. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies,
          this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. In addition, many web browsers support Do
          Not Track technology. If you enable Do Not Track, AblePay will not use information about your web viewing activities
          to tailor your online experience on other websites operated by AblePay. Note, however, that our third-party advertising
          providers may continue to use information about your web viewing activities to tailor advertising to your interests
          across different websites even when you have Do Not Track enabled in your browser.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Mobile device IDs.</span> If you&#8217;re using our app, we use mobile device IDs (the unique
          identifier assigned to a device by the manufacturer), or Advertising IDs (for iOS 6 and later), instead of cookies,
          to recognize you. We do this to store your preferences and track your use of our app. Unlike cookies, device IDs
          cannot be deleted, but Advertising IDs can be reset in &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; on your iPhone. Ad companies also
          use device IDs or Advertising IDs to track your use of the app, track the number of ads displayed, measure ad performance
          and display ads that are more relevant to you. Analytics companies use device IDs to track information about app
          usage.
        </li>
        <li><span class="underline">Modifying or Deleting your Information.</span> We respect your right to make choices about
          how we use and disclose your Personal Information. If you wish to modify the Personal Information you have provided
          to us, or if you would like us to delete your Personal Information from our records, please send an email to
          <a href="mailto:support@ablepayhealth.com">support@ablepayhealth.com</a>. We will respond to requests within the
          time allowed by all applicable privacy laws and will make every effort to respond as accurately and completely
          as possible.
        </li>

        <li><span class="underline">Acceptance of these Terms.</span> By using the Service, you signify your acceptance of this
          policy and any changes to this policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE OUR SERVICE. Your
          continued use of the Service following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of
          those changes.
        </li>
